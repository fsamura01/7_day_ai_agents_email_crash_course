Open a terminal in your VM and navigate to the Prefect storage folder:\n    ```bash\n    cd /path/to/your/prefect/storage\n    ```\n2.  Use `ncdu` or any other file exploration tool to find the large Prefect files.\n3.  Once you've located the large files, use the `rm` command to delete them:\n    ```bash\n    rm -rf /path/to/large/prefect/file\n    ```\n4.  After deleting the large files, ensure to update your flow code to eliminate any caching:\n    ```python\n    flow = prefect.Flow('flow_name')\n    flow.run_config = prefect.RunConfig(\n        tmp_dir='/path/to/new/temp/directory',  # Update this to a new temp directory\n        retry_max_delay=1800,  # Optional\n    )\n    ```",
