# GitHub Repository Conversational Agent

We'll create a conversational agent that can answer questions about any GitHub repository. Think of it as your personal AI assistant for documentation and code. If you're familiar with DeepWiki, it's similar, but tailored to your GitHub repository.

## Overview

This Course and project aims to build an intelligent assistant capable of understanding and querying the contents of a GitHub repository. By indexing the codebase and documentation, the agent can provide accurate answers to user queries, helping developers understand the code flow, usage, and structure without manually browsing through files.

## Features

- **Repository Indexing**: Parses and understands code and documentation from a specified GitHub repository.
- **Q&A Interface**: Allows users to ask natural language questions about the codebase.
- **Context-Aware**: Provides answers relevant to the specific repository context.

## Usage

*(Instructions on how to install and run the agent will be added here)*
