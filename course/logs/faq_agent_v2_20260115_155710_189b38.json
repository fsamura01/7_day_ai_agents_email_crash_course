If you are using Windows 10 Home or 11 Home, you will need to use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) instead.\n\nHere are the detailed steps:\n\n1. Ensure Hyper-V is enabled: You can do this by following the instructions on this [tutorial](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/install-and-configured-docker-desktop-in-windows-10/).\n2. Install Docker Desktop: You can download the Docker Desktop for Windows from the official Docker website.\n3. Install the command-line tools: If you are using Homebrew, you can install the command-line tools using the following command:\n```bash\nbrew install --cask docker\n```\n4. Run the Docker commands: Once you have installed Docker Desktop and the command-line tools, you can run the Docker commands using the following command:\n```bash\ndocker run -it --dns=8.8.8.8 --entrypoint=bash python:3.9\n```\nThis will give you a bash shell in a Docker container with Python 3.9 installed.\n\nReferences:\n\n* [Enable Hyper-V Option on Windows 10 / 11](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/install-and-configured-docker-desktop-in-windows-10/)\n* [Setting up Docker in macOS](https://medium.com/@vivekslair/setting-up-docker-in-macos-ee36d37b3be2)\n* [GitHub: WSL Issue 5393](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5393)",
